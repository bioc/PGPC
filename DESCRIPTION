Title: Experimental data and analysis of the chemical-genetic
        interaction screen in isogenic HCT116 cell lines
Version: 1.9.0

Description: This package contains the experimental data and a vignette
        guiding through the analysis of a chemical-genenetic
        interaction screen in isogenic HCT116 cell lines. The code can
        be executed to generate all results and figures for the
        manuscript "A chemical-genetic interaction map of small molecules using
        high-throughput imaging in cancer cells" accepted for publicaton at
        Molecular Systems Biology. Data availability: Complementary views on 
        this dataset are available through different repositories. The image
        data files are available from the BioStudies database at the European
        Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) under the accession S-BSMS-PGPC1
        (http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/studies/S-BSMS-PGPC1)
        An interactive front-end for exploration of the images is provided by
        the IDR database http://dx.doi.org/10.17867/10000101. 
        The authors are hosting an interactive webpage to browse images and
        interaction profiles at http://dedomena.embl.de/PGPC.
