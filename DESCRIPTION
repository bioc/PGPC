Title: Experimental data and analysis of the chemical-genetic
        interaction screen in isogenic HCT116 cell lines
Version: 0.99.6
Author: Felix Klein
Maintainer: Felix Klein <felix.klein@embl.de>
Description: This package contains the experimental data and a vignette
        guiding through the analysis of a chemical-genenetic
        interaction screen in isogenic HCT116 cell lines. The code can
        be executed to generate all results and figures for the
        manuscript "A chemical-genetic interaction map of small molecules using
        high-throughput imaging in cancer cells" accepted for publicaton at
        Molecular Systems Biology.
